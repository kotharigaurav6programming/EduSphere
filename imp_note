Problem : https://edusphere-0r2e.onrender.com/js/main.js will works fine and showing images and everything but when i go inside admin panel after login it shows https://edusphere-0r2e.onrender.com/admin/js/main.js and due to this scripts and images and stylesheet not implements so how to solve ? 

Solution : Your issue is that when you navigate to the admin panel (/admin), your assets (JS, CSS, images) are being looked for inside /admin/js/main.js instead of /js/main.js. This happens because the browser is treating relative paths incorrectly due to how they are referenced in your HTML.

‚úÖ Solution: Use Absolute Paths
Modify how you include your assets in EJS templates (or your frontend files). Instead of using relative paths, use absolute paths.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix script, styles, and images in EJS templates
Change this:

html
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<img src="images/logo.png">
To this:

html
<script src="/js/main.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
<img src="/images/logo.png">
Using / at the beginning ensures that assets always load from the root (/), no matter which page you are on.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Static Directory in Express
If you haven't already, make sure your Express app serves static files correctly:

javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const path = require('path');

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // Ensure public folder is used

// If your assets are inside a different folder, adjust accordingly:
app.use('/js', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/js')));
app.use('/css', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/css')));
app.use('/images', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/images')));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
Make sure your static assets (js, css, images) are inside the public directory.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative: Use base Tag in HTML (If Needed)
If you are unable to change every asset reference, you can also use the <base> tag in your <head> section:

html
<base href="/">
This tells the browser to always use / as the base for all relative URLs.

‚úÖ Final Check
After making these changes:

Deploy again to Render.
Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R).
Test if assets are loading properly on all pages, including /admin.
Let me know if you need further debugging! üöÄ

We use <base href="/"> in every ejs page inside <head> tag
